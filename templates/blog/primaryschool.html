        <strong>Rainbow Bilingual Primary School</strong> forms the foundation for a childâ€™s future learning.
        Whether you choose our <strong class="text-success">Foto</strong> or <strong class="text-success">Foreke</strong> campus, Rainbow Bilingual Primary School
         offers a challenging academic education in a creative, warm, and holistic learning environment
         that enables children to reach their full potential. We see the world as a classroom,
         and thus much of the teaching in the primary grades is done outside the traditional setting.
         <br> <br>

        Our two Bilingual Primary Schools welcome students of all regions without any descrimination.
        We aim to provide a high-quality education in the English tradition, customised to instil a sense of
        belonging in the new age soceity. Children attending our <strong class="text-primary">Foreke</strong> campus have the benefit of mixing with a
        bigger school community where they may read with French speaking students or meet them through inter-house competitions.
        Those pupils based at our <strong class="text-primary">Foto</strong>campus are in a close-knit
        environment where they can easily socialise.
        <h4>What makes our Primary School unique:</h4>

        <strong>Rainbow Bilingual Primary School</strong> offers the internationally recognised Cameroonian national
        curriculum, with modifications to contextualise the learning experience for  pupils. <br> <br>
        Our learning approach is inquiry-based and trans-disciplinary, creating a strong foundation for project-based
        learning, which is the focus in later years. <br> <br>
        One of our core values is health education, taught through all subjects and general school life.
         This includes a robust physical education programme, lots of time outdoors, nutritious homemade food,
         a positive school climate, and an emphasis on social development and mental health.
